You can take all of Haskell and compile it into a small core language. This
core language is usually called [System FC] in academic papers, or just "The Core
Language" when you're talking about the compiler. It's really just the Lambda
calculus -- but a typed Lambda calculus.

It has Lambda application, let-case constructor literals, casts and coercions.
